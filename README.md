Good Games (GGs) is a website similar to GoodReads. A website where you can search for all of your favorite games, add them to your list, rate them, discuss them, and share your favorites.

With this project I intend to create a wesbite using the RAWG API along with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.
Then in a follow up project I will use the data that I gathered from this project along with the API to create Dashboards and Analytics to show trends and insights about this data
